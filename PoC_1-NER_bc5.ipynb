    "sampletext2=\"Traditional machine learning methods used to detect the side effects of drugs pose significant challenges as feature engineering processes are labor-intensive, expert-dependent, time-consuming and cost-ineffective. Moreover, these methods only focus on detecting the association between drugs and their side effects or classifying drugâ€“drug interaction. Motivated by technological advancements and the availability of big data, we provide a review on the detection and classification of side effects using deep learning approaches. It is shown that the effective integration of heterogeneous, multidimensional drug data sources, together with the innovative deployment of deep learning approaches, helps reduce or prevent the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Deep learning approaches can also be exploited to find replacements for drugs which have side effects or help to diversify the utilization of drugs through drug repurposing.\""

The symptoms - other than mild vertigo/dizziness - subsided by 10/13. The mild vertigo continued and mild left ear pain began on 10/14. Ear pain continued, and, believing it was (as is often the case) viral, I didn't go to urgent care until 10/19, as the pain had not resolved. I was diagnosed with a bacterial ear infection and given amoxycillin. On 10/20 I woke up with high-tone hearing loss in the left ear (I was unable to hear the beep of my phone alarm or determine the direction the sound was coming from) and tinnitus. I called the urgent care aftercare phone line and was prescribed a Medrol pack and Flonase. After I finished the Medrol pack, I still had hearing loss, though it was a little better, and I had some mild pain in my left ear and a feeling of fullness. So on 10/27 I saw an ENT. The ENT found no signs of infections, but the hearing test showed significant hearing loss in the left ear. He prescribed a 12-day course of high-dose prednisone to help reduce inflammation. I took 60 mg for 6 days, then tapered off. My follow-up hearing test showed only a very small improvement. At this point, the ENT sent me for blood work and an MRI. The bloodwork and the MRI were all normal. That was the end of treatment. I continue to have hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear, as well as having bouts of dizziness if I move my head too quickly. I do not know that the Shingrix vaccine caused this hearing loss, but I've ultimately decided I should report my experience because of the timing of the two events was very close\",\n",
